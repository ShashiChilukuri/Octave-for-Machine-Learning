# Programming-for-Machine-Learning-basics-Repository
This repository contains different programming languages that I used for machine learning and their basics
1. Octave is software featuring a high-level programming language, primarily intended for numerical computations. Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
2. Python for machine learning
3. Python libraries - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Pytorch - A deep learning framework
  Part1:
  - Installation
  - Tensors
  - Quick Neural Network Background
  Part2:
  - 
  - Creating a neural network
5.
